# a simple app to show how much time is there between prayers
'cause I wanted to know how much time is there between asr and maghrib.



# The below is just some  references for my future self

## Prayer Times API
I used the [aladhan](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api) API to get the prayer time data.

## Postman workspace
Play around with this API [Here](https://myteam-9796.postman.co/workspace/Prayer-Times-API-(aladhan)~33c3d14a-e5cc-4336-9e93-0536acd664bd/request/42523776-beb1f52a-2e58-484e-8b11-3e572b05d94b?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=42523776)

## Font used
I used the Rubik font from [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?preview.text=%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AC%D8%B1%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B8%D9%87%D8%B1%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%A1&lang=ar_Arab&icon.size=24&icon.color=%23D9D9D9)

## Css Flex
I learned Flexbox stuff from this great guid [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-background)
highly reccommnded just to see what different propertys look like.

I also reccomend checking this hole website it seems like *the* place for css stuff
here is a great guids page they have stuff like *how to center things* and *CSS Length Units* and much more.
